1) aria-labelledby vs aria-label

aria-label: a literal string you put on the element to name it.

Use when there is no suitable visible text to reference.

Example: icon-only close button

<button type="button" aria-label="Close">
  <X aria-hidden="true" />
</button>


aria-labelledby: points to the ID(s) of other element(s) whose text becomes the name.

Best when there is visible text on the page you can reference. It stays in sync if that text changes.

Example: a <nav> titled by a visible heading

<h4 id="footer-socials">Socials</h4>
<nav aria-labelledby="footer-socials">â€¦</nav>


Precedence: if both are present, aria-labelledby wins (it overrides aria-label).
